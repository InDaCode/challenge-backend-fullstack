# Fullstack challenge
Welcome! Take your time to carefully read the notice before going ahead. It's well-invested time ðŸ™‚.

## Decription
This test consists in two major parts:
* The backend challenge (`challenge-backend` subdirectory) (Spring-Boot)
* The frontend challenge (`challenge-front` subdirectory) (React.js)

The frontend exercise implements the endpoint from the backend exercise. **You should therefore start with the backend challenge.**

Each subdirectory (`challenge-backend` and `challenge-front`) contains its own `README.md` that lays out the specifics of its challenge, as well as the expected business rules. Importing each subdirectory as an independant project in your IDE is recommended.

If you are blocked on the backend part of the challenge, you can use a mock of the expected result to proceed with the frontend challenge.

**The expected duration for this exercise is of 2 hours.**

## Prerequisites
The following software should be installed on your machine:
* Java 11
* Node 15+ and NPM

We highly recommend IntelliJ as your IDE.

## Expected delivery
The result of your test is expected in an archive containing both subdirectories, sent to your contact in the recruiting process.
